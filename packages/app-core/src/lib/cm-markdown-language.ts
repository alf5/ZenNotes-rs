/**
 * The note grammar every ZenNotes editor parses with: a leading YAML
 * frontmatter block carved out of the document, markdown for everything
 * after it.
 *
 * CommonMark knows nothing about frontmatter, so a note parsed as plain
 * markdown reads `key: value` lines followed by the closing `---` as a setext
 * heading (#827: the YAML header shows up in heading type) and the two fences
 * as horizontal rules. The properties card (cm-frontmatter.ts) used to paper
 * over that with CSS, but only inside the card, which does not load with Live
 * Preview off (#616), so the raw view was the one that broke.
 *
 * Why not the two obvious tools:
 *
 * - `yamlFrontmatter` from @codemirror/lang-yaml treats an unclosed `---` as
 *   YAML to the end of the document (a note that opens with a horizontal rule
 *   loses all markdown) and disagrees with `frontmatterRange` about a fence
 *   with stray whitespace, so the card and the grammar would drift apart.
 * - A markdown block-parser extension cannot see the closing fence when it is
 *   typed lines below an existing `---`: Lezer reuses the old HorizontalRule
 *   node from the previous tree and never re-runs the block parser on line 1,
 *   so the stale heading stays until the note is reopened.
 *
 * So this is a tiny outer parser. It re-scans the frontmatter range from the
 * raw input on every parse (O(1) unless line 1 is a fence, one pass to the
 * closing fence otherwise) and mounts the markdown parser onto the body
 * through `parseMixed`. The mount hands the previous markdown tree to the
 * inner parser as fragments, so body parsing stays incremental as long as the
 * body keeps its start: edits anywhere in the body or inside the frontmatter
 * reuse the untouched blocks.
 *
 * Two cases read again text that a plain markdown parser would reuse, and
 * both are kept on purpose. When the body start moves (the closing fence
 * typed for the first time, or broken), parseMixed cannot find the old mount
 * and the body is parsed in full, the same as opening the note. And the outer
 * tree always spans the whole note, so when a parse runs out of its 20 ms
 * slice, CodeMirror drops the older tree past that point and the parse that
 * resumes reads the rest again. Reusing the older blocks in those two cases
 * makes the tree go stale more often, because Lezer's markdown reuse can keep
 * a block whose meaning changed with text outside it: an indented code block
 * whose indent was deleted along with the frontmatter, a paragraph whose end
 * moved when a table row under it broke. Checked against a fresh parse 50,000
 * times over 100,000 random edits, this grammar was stale 3 times, the same
 * grammar with that reuse 29 times, and plain `markdown()` 205 times. The
 * cost is small: a typed character parses well inside its slice even in an
 * 800 KB note, and reading the rest after a cut costs what opening the note
 * costs, in background slices. The test file pins both behaviours.
 *
 * One consequence: `syntaxTree(state).length` is always the whole note, so it
 * does not say how far the parse got. Ask `ensureSyntaxTree` or
 * `syntaxTreeAvailable` instead, as `headingAbove` in table-to-database.ts
 * does.
 *
 * The frontmatter content is deliberately left untokenized: with Live Preview
 * off a note reads as its raw text (#616), and the card styles it when on.
 * Only the fences carry a token (`meta`), which the card already hides.
